      <h2>Artists and Sample Clearance Issues </h2>
      <article>
      <p> Now that we have how clearing a sample works lets look at some artists who have had issues and/or
       violated the sample clearing process itself:</p>
       <br>
       
       <h3><strong>Kanye West</strong></h3>
       <p>Starting off with probably the most controversial artist of all time, Kanye West. His 
       <strong>recent spiral outputting is the primary factor for why he has dealt with sample clearance issues</strong>. 
       Kanyes Music relies heavily on sampling and recently in 2024 on his album vultures he used a sample from
       Donna Summers "I feel love" without the permission from her estate. Quickly a day after the release of the song 
      <strong> Donna Summers estate managed to get the song removed off of streaming platforms </strong> and filled a lawsuit against Mr. West.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
       Additionally, Kanye had trouble clearing his famous song "Gold Digger" which was also<strong> taken to court by David Pryor</strong> the artist he sampled from
       however, the judge declared that sample was distorted and sounded nothing like the original song, allowing West to use the <strong>sample without copyright infringement</strong>.
       </p>
       <br>
       
       <h3><strong>Chance The Rapper</strong></h3>
       <p>Next, we have Chance The Rapper who is another popular artist that has dealt with sample clearance issues throughout his career.
       Most notably, with his single "Juice" off of his mixtape Acid Rap, which sampled John Lennons "Jealous Guy". The sample was not denied however after
       John Lennons passing his estate has rarely allowed approval of sampling due to respect to him and his family. <strong>Due to this Chance was un able to upload the
       song on his mixtape</strong></p>
       <br>
       
       <h3><strong>De La Soul</strong></h3>
       <p> De La Soul is a Hip-Hop Group while not wildly popular in this day of age, had an impact 
       in music earlier in time. Their Music production consisted heavily of samples however most 
       were uncleared and put on streaming without consent. <strong>This was a major problem and their entire
       music catalog was taken off of streaming for several years </strong> and they <strong> faced up to 2.5 million
       in fines</strong>. This is just an example of why it is important as an artist to clear samples.
       </p>
       <br>
       
      <h3><strong>Drake</strong></h3>
      <p>Finally we have world renown Drake.
      Drake had a lawsuit filed against him due to his sampled lyrics on his song "Poundcake" which
      sampled Jazz legend Jimmy Smiths lyrics from "Jimmy Smith Rap". <strong>Jimmy Smiths estate was furious about this
      and sued Drake </strong> for this even though Drake gained a license for use of the sample for sound. However, <strong>drake did not get a license
      for the use of lyrics which allowed the lawsuit to continue</strong>, however the court considered Drakes <strong>use of the sample fair use</strong> and allowed him 
      to use it</p>
