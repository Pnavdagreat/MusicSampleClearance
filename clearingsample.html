      <h2>How to clear a sample </h2>
      <article>
      <p> <strong> Clearing Samples </strong> as stated before can be a very difficult 
      process depending upon the person you're working with.
      However, it is important as an artist to remain patient and to trust the 
      process because it could be a lengthy and tedious process.
      </p>
      
      <p> To begin clearing a sample roughly takes around a couple of months to fully complete on average.
      In addition to do that in most cases clearing samples requires providing compensation in order to complete.
      As an artist, taking those things into consideration here is a step by step process on how to clear a sample: 
      </p>
      <br>
      
      <h3><strong>Step 1: Gather information about the song sample</strong></h3>
      <p> When you're looking to sample a song to use in your music it is important to gather
      information about the artist before you look to clear the sample. Some cases, the artist is
      no longer alive so you have to contact a relative or former manangement in relation to the
      artist. In other cases, the artist may be very popular and may need a lot from you in order to clear
      the sample, <strong>so make sure to do your research first</strong>
      </p><br>
      
      <h3><strong>Step 2: Apply for Clearance in Advance</strong></h3>
      <p>When you are sure that you want to use this specific sample, you should take initiative early.
      Contacting the legal company for the individual you're sampling from should be done immediately as
      you're finding early on if you're even allowed to use their work before beginning the creative process.
      </p><br>
      
      <h3><strong>Step 3: Waiting for approval and proceed after decision </strong></h3>
      <p> This third step is normally just a waiting process as you wait for your decision. Once the legal
      team decides if they dont want to let you use their work. Then this process ends right here and
      you just cannot use the song, however if they agree to let you use it then you move to the next step.
      </p><br>
      
      <h3><strong>Step 4: Negotiate to terms</strong></h3>
      <p> If you made it to this point it is likely that you have been approved to use the sample.
      Now that you have been approved both legal teams have to work together to negotiate a deal 
      where the lending artists gets fair compensation for the use of the sample.
      </p><br>
      
      <h3><strong>Step 5: Finalize the deal</strong></h3>
      <p> Once negotiations are complete, your able to close the deal and rightfully have permission to use the 
      sample however you would like.
      </p><br>
