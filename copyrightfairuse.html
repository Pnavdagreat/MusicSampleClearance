      <h2>Fair Use and Copyright </h2>
      <article>
      
      <p> As seen with some artists such as Drake on the page about artists and sample issues, <strong>in some cases
      lawsuits can be dropped</strong>, and judges can allow use of samples without following sample clearance guidelines
      if it falls under <strong>fair use.</strong></p>
      
      <p> As an artist who is looking to sample music it is important to understand the rights of fair use and copyright
      in order to sample music, as knowing what is considered copyright and what is considered fair use is important
      to know what rights you have as an artist, so here is information about each to consider: </p>
    <br>
      
      
      <h3><strong>Composition</strong></h3>
      <p>First we have Composition <strong>which is basically the lyrics of a song</strong>. Copyright under Composition is considered if you
      as an artist use the same lyrics as ones from the song. For example, with Drakes case he had to obtain a Composition clearance
      in order to use "Jimmy Smith Rap". Additionally, this goes for any sort of sampling if you are gaining sample clearance many artists don't
      realize that <strong>you must gain clearance for the lyrics sampled separately</strong> and this where they get caught up in legal issues.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3><strong>Production/Recording</strong></h3>
      <p>The second copyright form is recording/production. This goes for the entire recording itself and or the production behind the sample.
      <strong>In most cases artists are more aware about this form of copyright</strong> as many times artists believe this is the only form of copyright before
      doing research. However, in order to clear a sample it is important to get clearance from both types of copyright.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3><strong>Fair Use </strong></h3>
      
      <p>Next we have Fair Use, and Fair use is the idea to let artists use copyrighted material depending on in most cases two factors which include: </p>
      <br>
      
       <h3><strong>Amount of Sample Used</strong></h3>
       <p> While <strong>in most cases even seconds of a song is considered copyright</strong>. However, Judges tend to lean towards fair use
       if the work that is sampled does not sound similar to the person sampled. This could be that the artist distorted the voice, changed
       the production, or just used the sample in such a short amount of time that it was not noticeable.</p>
       <br>
       
        <h3><strong>Purpose</strong></h3>
        <p> <strong>Purpose is considered if the artist sampling the meaning is adding purpose to the music</strong> rather than just straight up copying the work.
        <strong>In most cases copyright is copyright</strong> and most judges would lean towards making someone guilty if they use someones work without permission. 
        However, a judge could rule copyright as purposeful fair use if they see that the artist is using the sample to change something rather than copying it. </p>
