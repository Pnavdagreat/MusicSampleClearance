        <p><strong>Music Sampling</strong> is a major part of music and its the process 
        of using a portion of another individual's work and 
        adding it into your own work.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>Mainly seen in music production, music sampling can range from short snippets of a verse 
        or beat to sometimes a remake of an entire song.</p>
        <br>
        
         <p>Music sampling has been a popular form of music creation since the last 1900s moving into even today as it has led to creation of many of the
         top songs we hear today such as: </p>
         <br>
         
        <ul> 
         <li> Song: "Stronger" by Kanye West. Sampled: "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" Daft Punk</li>
         <li> Song: "Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla Ice. Sampled: "Under Pressure", Queen </li>
         <li> Song: "Crazy In Love" Beyonce. Sampled: "Are you my Woman?", The Chi-Lites</li>
         </ul>
        <br><br>
        
        <p>Music sampling has been prominent in all genres of music but most notably <strong>Hip-Hop</strong>, 
        <strong>Pop</strong>, <strong> R&B</strong>, and even <strong>Jazz</strong> with artists sampling music during live
        performances.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>However, while music sampling has been such an important part of music since its creation, changing the game and allowing 
        for new innovative ideas that have led to the creation of some  of the best songs in recent history, 
        <strong>not everyone agrees with the idea of music sampling</strong> with very notable artists such as prince 
        stating how sampling other artists music is seen as disrespectful and unfair.
         </p>
         
         <br>
         
         <p> With many people and artists considering music sampling an act of plagiarism,it leaves 
         artists who are interested in the creative side of music upset as they're not able to fully
         express themselves. This has led to music sampling being one of the most controversial topics 
         as many seem to agree while others don't leading to the topic at issue, <strong> music sample clearance's </strong>.
